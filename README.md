# 7nm Finfet Circut design (BGR)
## What is Finfet ?
FinFET (Fin Field-Effect Transistor) is a 3D transistor structure used in modern VLSI technology to overcome the limitations of planar MOSFETs at very small technology nodes.

## What makes FinFET special?
The channel is shaped like a vertical fin standing on the silicon substrate. The gate wraps around the fin on 2 or 3 sides, giving much better control over the channel.
