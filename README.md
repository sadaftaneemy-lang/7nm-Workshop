# 7nm Finfet Circut design (BGR)
## What is Finfet ?
FinFET (Fin Field-Effect Transistor) is a 3D transistor structure used in modern VLSI technology to overcome the limitations of planar MOSFETs at very small technology nodes.

## What makes FinFET special?
The channel is shaped like a vertical fin standing on the silicon substrate. The gate wraps around the fin on 2 or 3 sides, giving much better control over the channel.

The figure titled “50 Years of Microprocessor Trend Data” illustrates the long-term evolution of microprocessor technology from the 1970s to around 2020 by showing how key architectural and physical parameters have scaled over time. Over the decades, the number of transistors on a chip has continued to increase exponentially, following Moore’s Law, enabled by advances in semiconductor fabrication and device scaling.

🔹 1. Transistors (orange ▲)
- Grows exponentially over time
- This is Moore’s Law: transistor count doubles roughly every 18–24 months
- Still increasing even today
  
🔹 2. Single-Thread Performance (blue ●)
- Increased rapidly until ~2005
- After that, growth slows significantly
- Reason: limits of frequency and power
  
🔹 3. Clock Frequency (green ■)
- Rose steadily up to ~2005 (~3–4 GHz)
- Then plateaued
- This is the Frequency Wall
  
🔹 4. Typical Power (red ▼)
- Increased until ~2005
- Then flattened
- Indicates the Power / Thermal Wall
- Chips cannot consume more power without overheating
  
🔹 5. Number of Logical Cores (black ◆)
- Stayed low until ~2005
- After that, increases sharply
- Industry shifted to multi-core processors
